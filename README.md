# iflashc
*Integrated Flash Card* is a tool for memorizing English words on your Unix system.
Whenever I encounter a new English word in a PDF book or on a manpage, I copy it,
look up the translation in Google Translate, and write it on physical flashcards to practice.
But I can imagine a better design and solution. iflashc is exactly what I wantâ€”an integrated
tool that translates words and expands your vocabulary library.
